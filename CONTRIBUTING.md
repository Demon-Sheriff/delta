# Contributing to Delta

This section will serve as a comprehensive guide for developers contributing to the project. It provides information about the codebase, project structure, workflows, and best practices. Whether you’re a new contributor or a seasoned developer, this section will help you work effectively with the codebase. **Note that this is a work in progress.**

We love contributions! However, note that it’s important that you first talk to us in Discussions about what you are planning to do so we both save time and effort. If it’s only bug fixes or documentation, feel free to send PR, those are more likely to pass directly.
